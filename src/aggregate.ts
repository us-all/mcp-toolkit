/**
 * Aggregation helper — run a bag of named async fetchers in parallel via
 * `Promise.allSettled`, push labeled rejection messages onto a caveats array,
 * and return a typed object whose values are `null` for any rejected fetcher.
 *
 * Designed for the aggregation-tool pattern where one failed sub-call should
 * not poison the whole response (the surviving values still flow through, and
 * the partial-data condition is surfaced via the returned `caveats` array).
 *
 * Each consumer MCP previously inlined this logic — typically 10-15 lines per
 * aggregation tool. This helper is the deduplication.
